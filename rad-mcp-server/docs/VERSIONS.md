# Versions

How rad-mcp components are versioned, and what's current. The **live source of
truth** is the `list_versions` MCP tool (returns the server + every skill +
every driver in one call); the server version is additionally reported via MCP
`serverInfo` at the `initialize` handshake (e.g. Claude Code `/mcp`). The
snapshot below is maintained by hand — update it in the same change that bumps a
component.

## Current — snapshot 2026-07-14

**MCP server:** `0.1.0`

| Skill | Version |
|---|---|
| `rad-core` | 1.0.0 |
| `rad-cli-operations` | 1.0.0 |
| `rad-device-mng` | 1.0.0 |

| Driver (family) | Version | Product |
|---|---|---|
| `secflow` | 1.0 | SecFlow / SF-1p |
| `etx1p` | 1.0 | ETX-1p |
| `etx2` | 1.0 | ETX-2 (203AX / 205A / 220A / 2I) |
| `mp4100` | 1.0 | Megaplex-4100 |
| `mp1` | 1.0 | MP-1 |

## Where each version lives (what to bump)

- **Server** — `server/rad_mcp/__init__.py` `__version__`, kept in sync with
  `server/pyproject.toml` and `.claude-plugin/plugin.json` (all three must
  match). Surfaced through `FastMCP(version=...)` → MCP `serverInfo`.
- **Skill** — `skills/<name>/SKILL.md`: the `version:` frontmatter field **and**
  the `> **Skill version:**` line at the top of the body — keep the two equal.
- **Driver** — `server/rad_mcp/drivers/<family>.py`: the `version` class
  attribute **and** the `Driver version:` line in the module docstring.

## Bump policy

- Bump a **skill** on any content change to its `SKILL.md`.
- Bump a **driver** when that family's behavior changes — contexts, health
  sweep, SSH connection profile, dialect quirks — not for doc-only tweaks.
- Bump the **server** on a release (all three server-version locations together).
- Semver-ish: patch = fixes, minor = additive, major = breaking.

## Checking what's actually loaded

- **`list_versions` tool** → server + all skills + all drivers, one call
  (works on every transport, including Claude Desktop).
- **`/mcp`** (or the client's server-info panel) → the server version from the
  handshake.
- **Files** → grep `version:` in `skills/*/SKILL.md`, `version =` in
  `server/rad_mcp/drivers/*.py`.

### Drift check

The versions a running client reports come from its **deployed skill copies**
(`~/.copilot/skills`, `~/.claude/skills`, `~/.agents/skills`, and the Claude
Desktop zip), not from this repo. If those don't match the table above, the
client is on a stale copy — re-run its installer (and rebuild/re-upload the
Desktop zip) to resync.
